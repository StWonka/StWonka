👋 Hi, I’m @StWonka, I just started this journey into programming and coding. I've always been a gamer and I still remember playing games at the arcades when I was in 3rd grade.
- 👀 I’m interested in playing games, going to the gym, playing some sports here and there, and reading books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning with The Odin Project and finishing a free course of CS50 on Harvards online course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on and hopefully any tripple A games studios.
- 📫 How to reach me is at ortegajv3@gmail.com or xaos037@gmail.com
